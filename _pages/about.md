Wai Shing Tang, Ph.D.
======
I am currently a Flatiron Research Fellow, Structural and Molecular Biophysics Collaboration, CCM, Flatiron Institute, New York, NY, since June 2022. My research involves the development of novel mathematical and computational methods to characterize protein structural dynamics with molecular dynamics simulations. I hold a Ph.D. in Physics from Brown University and a B.Sc. in Physics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
